# 🏨 Hotel Management System – "Grand Sapphire"

This is a C++ based Hotel Management System developed as a part of the B.Tech Project-I course (CS3201) at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Senapati, Manipur.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Hotel Management System** is designed to automate and streamline key operations of a hotel such as:

- Room bookings
- Guest check-ins and check-outs
- Restaurant ordering
- Billing and invoice generation
- Feedback collection
- Report generation

The system uses file handling for data persistence (`Record.txt` and `Feedback.txt`) and offers a secure, menu-driven console interface for staff.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Eliminate manual hotel processes with automation
- Provide secure storage for guest and room information
- Support complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
